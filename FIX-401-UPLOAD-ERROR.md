# üîß Fix for 401 Unauthorized Error on Document Upload

## Problem
When trying to upload a document, you receive:
```
INFO:     127.0.0.1:53439 - "POST /api/contracts/upload HTTP/1.1" 401 Unauthorized
```

## Root Cause
The 401 Unauthorized error occurs because the upload endpoint requires authentication, but either:
1. You're not logged in (no token in localStorage)
2. Your login token has expired (tokens expire after 30 minutes)
3. The token is invalid or malformed

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Check Your Authentication Status
Open this URL in your browser: http://localhost:3000/auth-debug.html

This tool will show you:
- ‚úÖ If you have a valid token
- ‚è∞ When your token expires
- üë§ Your user information
- üß™ Test your API connection

### Step 2: Log In to the Application
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/login
2. Use your credentials:
   - Email: `anasrworking@gmail.com`
   - Password: (the password you set during signup)
3. After successful login, you'll be redirected to the dashboard

### Step 3: Try Uploading Again
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/upload
2. Select or drag & drop a PDF or DOCX file
3. Click "Upload" button

## What We Fixed

### Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/app/upload/page.tsx`)
1. ‚úÖ Added authentication check on page load
2. ‚úÖ Added automatic redirect to login if not authenticated
3. ‚úÖ Improved error handling for 401 responses
4. ‚úÖ Added proper error messages
5. ‚úÖ Added token expiration handling with auto-logout

### Backend Verification
- ‚úÖ Confirmed authentication system is working
- ‚úÖ Verified user exists in database
- ‚úÖ Tested token generation

## Quick Test Commands

### Test Backend Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Test Login (Get Token)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"anasrworking@gmail.com","password":"YOUR_PASSWORD"}'
```

### Test Upload with Token
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/contracts/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -F "file=@path/to/your/file.pdf"
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get 401 after logging in:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Check localStorage for `access_token`
4. If missing, try logging out and logging in again

### If token keeps expiring:
- Tokens expire after 30 minutes
- You'll need to log in again after expiration
- Consider implementing token refresh in the future

### If you can't log in:
1. Check backend is running: `cd backend && python main.py`
2. Check frontend is running: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Verify database exists: `backend/clm_database.db`

## Files Modified
1. `frontend/src/app/upload/page.tsx` - Added authentication checks
2. `frontend/public/auth-debug.html` - New debug tool
3. `backend/test_auth.py` - New test script

## Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ Log in through the frontend
2. ‚úÖ Verify you have a token using the debug tool
3. ‚úÖ Try uploading a document
4. ‚úÖ If it still fails, check the browser console for detailed error messages

## Additional Notes
- Token is stored in browser's localStorage
- Token expires after 30 minutes (configurable in `backend/src/config/settings.py`)
- Each request to `/api/contracts/upload` requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- Frontend automatically includes this header if you're logged in
